# Info Sec Toolkit with Snowflakes: Decoded.
My Own Arsenals with Information Security, Toolkit. I am planning to expand these for Apple-based Codex, Like the Mach-O Kernel; and Darwin Kernel, For Unlocking Apple-based Products, Its not called Intellectual Theft for Blueprints, Its called Reverse Engineering without Damaging any of their Products, As is; It might not also be prior to misconduct a Theft of their Property, Because this is a Knowledgebase of Tools and the Famous Quote: "Hack to Learn" ..

## Tools: I Uploaded Here.

Windows / Linux Version:

1) Terminus - Toolkit, for Connecting System Calls into the CLI-based Command line. Otherwise called as a Terminal Emulator; For Windows and Linux like Environments. For Windows 10, Install Bash, because any ELF Code running on any DoS Operating Systems won't run. For Linux, I recommend any; As it is not necessary and of course Cross-Compatible with any sort of Linux or Unix OS. It can run on almost any sort of Linux Environment as this was Hard-Coded based on ELF Code as is, It is an Environment-based Terminal Emulator; So you'd have to package the Prerequisites yourself.

Preview of Terminus:

OSX / Mach-O Version:
