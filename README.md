# Info Sec Toolkit with Snowflakes: Decoded.
My Own Arsenals with Information Security, Toolkit.

## Tools: I Uploaded Here.

1) Terminus - Toolkit, for Connecting System Calls into the CLI-based Command line. Otherwise called as a Terminal Emulator; For Windows and Linux like Environments. For Windows 10, Install Bash, because any ELF Code running on any DoS Operating Systems won't run. For Linux, I recommend any; As it is not necessary and of course Cross-Compatible with any sort of Linux or Unix OS. It can run on almost any sort of Linux Environment as this was Hard-Coded based on an Environment-based Terminal Emulator; So you'd have to package it yourself.
