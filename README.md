# Info Sec Toolkit with Snowflakes: Decoded.
My Own Arsenals with Information Security, Toolkit.

## Tools: I Uploaded Here.

1) t.exe - Toolkit, for Connecting System Calls into the CLI-based Command line. Otherwise called as Terminal.exe; For Windows and Linux like Environments. For Windows 10, Install Bash, because any ELF Code running on any DoS Operating Systems won't run. For Linux, I recommend any; As it is not necessary and of course Cross-Compatible with any sort of Linux or Unix OS.
